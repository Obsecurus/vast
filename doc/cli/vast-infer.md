The `vast infer` command attempts to derive a schema from user input. Upon
success, it prints a schema template to standard output.

The `vast infer` command is currently able to infer schemas for the Zeek TSV and
JSON formats. Note that the input is required to be JSON, and unlike other VAST
commands, JSONL (newline-delimited JSON) is not supported.

Example usage:

```sh
gunzip -c integration/data/json/conn.log.json.gz |
  head -1 |
  vast infer
```

Note that the output of the `vast infer` command still needs to be manually
edited in case there was an ambiguity, as the type system of the data source
format may be less strict than the data model used by VAST. E.g., there is no
way to represent an IP address in JSON other than using a string type.

The `vast infer` command is a good starting point for writing custom schemas,
but is not designed to be a replacement for it.
